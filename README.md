This was one of my assignments for the 2025 fall semester. It's an example of what I've known from the end of the Spring semester to the start of this fall. This was during our review phase of the course. As of writing this, September 21st, we haven't covered much new content. Binary Search Trees and hashmaps are the next focus.

The main purpose was to ensure that we understand the basics of .compareTo() when definining a comparible class, as well as other general class construction formatting. It was also done to strengthen our ideas of file parsing and sorting lists. We'd also just went over ananynomus functions as well. The CSV file was edited to have duplicate objects in the list to search for. Other than that, it is in the state given to me by my professor.

The Long comments with the numbers in front are were what the assigned prompts were. Any other comments were notes for myself while coding the methods.
